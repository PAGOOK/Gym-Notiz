# Gym-Notiz

What is Gym-Notes?<br>
Gym Notes is an Android-app that allows you to quickly and easily save and retrieve your gym-records for various fitness exercises.<br>
I no longer have the time to continue developing the app.<br>

If anyone optimizes and publishes this app, please include me as a co-creator as <i>P A G O O K</i> and let me know where it was published.

The app was written in Python and Kivy.
